It is a simple, mathematical truth baked into how money compounds to create wealth. A 20% loss only requires a 25% gain to get back to even, but a 50% loss requires an astounding 100% gain and a 90% loss requires an impossibly large 900% gain — just to get back to even. The math is unequivocal: It is not how much you make when you are right that determines your wealth, but how much you lose when you are wrong.</p>

Newsflash: it's not! I've had countless people approach me looking for my approval on some random stock tip that someone (usually with no investing experience) has given them the inside scoop on. Next time this happens, the easiest way to make money is to not invest in it. </p>

Although this is not a new idea and is rather simple I am amazed at the success my clients have, when they do that one simple thing. High income will not make you wealthy, saving and spending responsibly can.</p>

If you want to contribute the max to your Roth IRA each year, set up direct deposit from your paycheck to automatically deposit $192.30 (if paid bi-weekly) into your IRA account. Most brokers offer this option, but you can simply ask for the broker's routing number and then your account number.</p>
